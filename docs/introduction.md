## What is a RESTful Services?

>Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used 
for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services, 
provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems 
to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless 
operations.

In short we can conclude that Rest is a web service that helps us in exchanging the data between client and server 
over HTTP protocol

e.g. GET http://api.example.com/collections

#### Advantages of using REST API
1. Uses HTTP protocol
2. Seperation between client and server
3. visibility, reliablity and scalability
4. platform/language independent solution
5. allows greater variety of data formats

#### Main componets REST services
1. Resource URL
2. Request verb
3. Request Headers
4. Request Body
5. Request Params
6. Path Variables
7. Response Body
8. Response Status Code

#### Popular REST Verbs
1. GET
2. POST
3. PUT
4. DELETE
